//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading the free sample version of Will's Pixel Explosions. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

---TIPS AND TRICKS---

- In the main folder, you'll see 1 folder for each animation. I've tried to name them as descriptively as I can!

- In each animation folder, you'll find a "PNG" folder. This is where the individual frames of the animation are.

- In each animation folder, you'll also find a folder called "spritesheet." In this folder is all the individual frames packed into one image. The accompanying text file is metadata describing where each frame is on the spritesheet.
The metadata format is:
(frame name) = x y width height

- Want more? The full pack includes 10 explosion animations, with 4 color styles each. That's 40 explosions total!
Buy the full pack here: https://untiedgames.itch.io/wills-pixel-explosions

---FRAME DURATIONS---

Each animation has specific durations for each frame, measured in milliseconds.
Fortunately, this asset pack is easy: They're all 60 FPS animations! That means 16.67 milliseconds per frame.
